	<p>Starting this space of random thoughts before the year is over. It's always better to be already done with your new year resolutions before the year even starts.
I'll try to post here whatever development I am currently working in. Maybe I will post some of my old ones too, I don't know. </p>
<p>I am currently working as a Java Web Developer so I won't be talking much about that. Surely you can expect to see things about <strong>WebAssembly</strong>, <strong>Numerical Analysis</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong> (not anything related to NN tho), some <strong>Python</strong> snipets and a bit of basic <strong>C</strong>. Furthermore, I might bring some interesting mathy topics around if I find the time to do so!</p>
<p>This site is a static website build on <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> with <a href="https://flask-flatpages.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/">Flask-Flatpages</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a>. The styling is completely based on the Jekyll's theme <a href="https://github.com/chesterhow/tale">Tale</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/chesterhow">ChesterHow</a>. Go ahead and take a look at <a href="https://chester.how/">his website</a>. I have planned to modify it in the future in order to have something more personal, but for sure is a very nice foundation to work with.</p>
<p>See you later!</p>
